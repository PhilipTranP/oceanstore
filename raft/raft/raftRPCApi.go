//Invoked by leader to replicate log entries. Also, used as heartbeat between leaders and followers.
/*
Log Matching Proprty - If two entries in different logs have the same index and term, then the logs are identical in all preceding entries.
This property is guaranteed by a simple consistency check performed by AppendEntries. When sending an AppendEntries RPC,
the leader includes the index and term of the entry in its log that immediately precedes the new entries.
If the follower does not find an entry in its log with the same index and term, then it refuses the new entries.
The consistency check acts as an induction step: the initial empty state of the logs satisfies the Log Matching Property,
and the consistency check preserves the Log Matching Property whenever logs are extended. As a result, whenever AppendEntries returns successfully,
the leader knows that the followerâ€™s log is identical to its own log up through the new entries.
