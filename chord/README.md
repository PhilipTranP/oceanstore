# Chord

Chord is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash table</a> protocol. Its design is motivated from <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf">Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications</a> paper. Chord distributes objects over a dynamic network of nodes, and implements a protocol for finding these objects once they have been placed in the network.
